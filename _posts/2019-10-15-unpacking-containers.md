I worked in commercial I.T. for a few years before doing an PhD and spending many years in scientific research. Coming back to software full time is a bit like coming out of cryo-stasis: Technology has moved on in ways I could not possibly have imagined and I must adapt like some kind of sci-fi person. One of the big changes over the last few years has been the increased use of virtual machines (e.g. using Virtualbox) and containers (Docker is a popular choice). I now feel ready to talk about this with others.
