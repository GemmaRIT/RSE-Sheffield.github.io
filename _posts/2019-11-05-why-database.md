Figuring out how to store research data is potentially a bit of a headache - we have to balance data security, integrity and availability. Databases offer a means of doing research data management better, but setting them up is out of reach for many researchers. Especially those doing small or pilot studies. This is an example of something someone probably never said to me:

> "Honestly, it's just going to make things more complicated, less flexible, it'll be out of my control on a server somewhere and what's a server anyway? So shut up Bob, I'm not using a database. Anyway, you just want to make a new shiny software thing because that's what you like doing. My spreadsheet is fine. Go away."

## Data matters


## The current situation


## In praise of the spreadsheet

Spreadsheets can be fantastic. They offer a great way to represent tablular data on-screen and do things with it. In fact you can put tables anywhere you want and make calculations with them. They're quick to set up, lots of people know how to use them and you can now have them sat in the cloud such that multiple users can access and edit them. You can make charts and paste these into a word processor. Lots of data comes to us in a spreadsheet-like format.
