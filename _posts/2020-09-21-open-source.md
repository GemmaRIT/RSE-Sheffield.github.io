This is going to be my perspective, to some extent, but hopefully also introduces some of the legal, technical, economic and academic aspects of open source – providing context for experts and a gateway for the newly interested. But, my perspective, so we’re going back to when I was first exposed to open source, back around the millennium…

Open source was an ideological battleground. Really. The dotcom bubble had burst. Everyone had a phone, but no-one had a smartphone. If you accessed the internet is was almost certainly via a PC or laptop running Microsoft Windows. People were beginning to realise that the internet could be used to transfer music, games and videos at scale, but there were few paid ways of doing this, so using a peer file sharing network to illegally download was increasingly commonplace. People felt OK about this, as they saw themselves as were depriving large corporations of small amounts of revenue. Said large corporations took a different stance – peer sharing was going to destroy all music, much as home taping had a generation before. Why am I banging on about this? Copyright. In much of the world, if you produce some music, or some text, or some code, for a period of time no-one is allowed to copy it without your permission. This right is something you can sell. An while copyright was something the peer-sharers ignored, it is a pillar of open source software, as we shall see.

While record labels and movie producers were worried about file sharing, some large software companies were worried about something else: open source software. Their model was to keep the source code to their products secret, to stop people from copying it. They would sell compiled versions of their software in which the source code was effectively hidden. Copyright and secrecy was what prevented their products being cheaply duplicated. Open source software, chiefly the Linux operating system, was beginning to subvert this model. Without copying the (copyright-protected) source code, software was emerging that had similar features to closed-source products, but licensed differently. Closed-source software is sold to you with a license which says you can’t copy it and give it to someone else.
