We offer a limited "free at the point of use" support service: [code clinics](../support/code-clinic.md) which allow researchers to spend time with RSEs working on problems. More general software support within the University of Sheffield is provided by [IT Services](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research/support), who also offer a range of [free training courses](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research/training/timetable).

The RSE team can deliver of a range of training courses. Several members of the team are ["Software Carpentry"](https://software-carpentry.org/) trainers and we can tailor and deliver these courses. We have recently delivered training commissioned by Doctoral Training Centres on "Reproducible Research Data & Project Management in R" and on use of the Linux shell for accessing HPC systems.

Some example topics in which we have expertise include:

- Python
- R
- Matlab
- Reproducible Research
- C, C+, C++
- git and GitHub
- Linux shell
- High Performance Computing
- GPU Computing

Our team has a very broad range of skills and we are passionate about passing them on. We can develop bespoke training courses to suit your department, research group or team. If you are interested in training, please [contact us](../contact/index.md).
