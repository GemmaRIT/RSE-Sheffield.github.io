We offer a "free at the point of use" support service:
[code clinics](../support/code-clinic.md) which allow researchers to spend time with RSEs working on problems.
More general software support within the University of Sheffield is provided by [IT Services][its],
who also offer a range of [free training courses][its-courses].

The RSE team can deliver of a range of training courses. 
Several members of the team are certified ["Carpentry"][carpentries] instructors
and we can tailor and deliver these courses.
[Software Carpentry][soft-carp] and [Data Carpentry][data-carp] are
training programmes designed to equip researchers
with the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain.
A Carpentry workshop is a hands-on, (typically) two-day event that covers
the core computing skills needed to be productive in a small research team.
Short tutorials alternate with practical exercises, and
all instruction is done via live coding.

We have recently delivered training commissioned by Doctoral Training Centres on ["Reproducible Research Data & Project Management in R"][repro-res-r] and 
on [use of the Linux shell for accessing HPC systems][hpc-carp-shell].

Some example topics in which we have expertise include:

- Python
- R
- MATLAB
- Reproducible research
- C and C++
- git and GitHub
- Linux shell
- High Performance Computing
- GPU Computing
- Systems administration inc. Docker and Ansible

Our team has a very broad range of skills and we are passionate about passing them on. We can develop bespoke training courses to suit your department, research group or team. If you are interested in training, please [contact us](../contact/index.md).
