title: "Deep Learning at TUOS: workflows, tooling and platforms"
---

The Faculty of Engineering at TUOS and the AMRC are to hold a two-hour workshop on data science
to help better identify relevant opportunities and collaborators for future AMRC projects.

At this workshop the RSE team will provide a brief overview of:

 - What the team can offer in general
 - Deep learning (DL) projects the team has contributed to 
 - Computational platforms that would be suitable for DL (specifically HPC systems containing GPUs)
 - How to collaborate with us.
