The University of Sheffield hosts
a UKRI-funded [Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Speech and Language Technologies (SLT)](https://slt-cdt.ac.uk/).
It is anticipated that 60 PhD students will be involved with this CDT over a period of 8 years,
with many being based in the Department of Computer Science.

This talk ([slides](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/rse-dcs-pres-on-hpc/)) is for the second (2020) cohort of PhD students and covers:

  - What high-performance computing (HPC) clusters are and why they can be useful in research environments;
  - The HPC clusters available at TUOS 
    and the ring-fenced resources the Dept of Computer Science has in these clusters;
  - Moving data to/from HPC systems and options for storing data;
  - Using a job scheduler such as Grid Engine to run interactive and batch jobs;
  - How to load/install/manage software on HPC systems;
  - Options for improving performance, inc. via parallelisation;
  - Larger and/or more specialised HPC systems
    and cloud computing;
  - Getting support from RSE team and IT Services and 
    collaborating with the RSE team.
