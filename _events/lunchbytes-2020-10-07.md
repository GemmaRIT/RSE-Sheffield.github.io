*LunchBytes is a new monthly series of short talks for those in the research community at TUOS who work with/write code, use/manage research data and use/manage research infrastructure. We hope through these talks we will come together as a community to discuss best practices and useful methods/tools.*

Notebooks (Jupyter, R etc) have become a popular tools for research and prototyping in data science, but what are the advantages and pitfalls?
At this LunchBytes event we'll be exploring computational notebooks and their pros and cons via three short talks.
Each will be ~10 minutes, leaving half an hour for discussion/questions.
