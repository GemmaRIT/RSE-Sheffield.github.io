This workshop is organised by VI-HPS for the ARCHER2 service and the UK PRACE Advanced Training Centre to:

* give an overview of the VI-HPS programming tools suite
* explain the functionality of individual tools, and how to use them effectively
* offer hands-on experience and expert assistance using the tools

On completion participants should be familiar with common performance analysis and diagnosis techniques and how they can be employed in practice (on a range of HPC systems).

Presentations and hands-on sessions will take place on the UK national supercomputer ARCHER, and are on the following topics:

* Paraver/Dimemas (BSC)
* TAU (UOregon)
* core-P/Scalasca/Cube (JSC)
* MAQAO (UVSQ)
* ARM Forge (ARM)

A brief overview of the capabilities of these and associated tools is provided in the VI-HPS Tools Guide.
