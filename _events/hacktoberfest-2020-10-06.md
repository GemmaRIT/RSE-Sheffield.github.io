Many of the world's most influential software projects are open source - and it doesn't take a master developer to contribute meaningful code and help them improve. Hacktoberfest is all about encouraging meaningful contributions to the open-source ecosystem
and Hacktoberfest meetups are **for beginners and veterans alike**!

[Research Software Engineering (RSE) Sheffield](/),
are organising a **series in of hackathons** during October
as part of [**Hacktoberfest 2020**][hacktoberfest],
a **global initiative to encourage participation in open-source software projects**.

The focus of this initial session will be on using GitHub to explore and contribute to open-source projects. We'll start with an introduction to how to contribute via git and GitHub, then move on to some hands-on tutorials using either RStudio, GitKraken/VScode or command line git (your choice!).

**Get free swag!** - By making 4 contributions to open source projects on GitHub during October, you will earn a free stylish Hacktoberfest t-shirt! See [Hacktoberfest][hacktoberfest] for details.

Whilst we'll be using the University of Sheffield's Blackboard Collaborate platform to host the events, they're open for anyone in Sheffield to come along and participate. [**Please register your interest using this Google Form**](https://forms.gle/hkJtLUTgrNamANF86) and we'll send you the link to the meetups.

Each Tuesday for the rest of October we'll be hosting online meetups for you to contribute to more projects and earn your pull requests. See the [RSE events page](/events) for details.
