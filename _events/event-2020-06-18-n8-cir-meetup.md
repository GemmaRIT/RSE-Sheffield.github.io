Speed blogging events are fun, interactive and engaging sessions.
Participants work in small groups to document ideas, opinions and challenges.
It is a great way to get to know other RSEs, share ideas and have a chance to get a voice.
This session will be led by Kirsty Pringle from the University of Leeds
with additional support from Alison Clarke and Marion Weinzierl, both from Durham University.
