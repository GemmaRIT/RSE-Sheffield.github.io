This session, hosted by Microsoft’s Education team, will introduce Microsoft’s Azure platform with a specific focus on HPC, HTC and Cyclecloud before going on to talk about using the public cloud for remote research.

It is the first in a series of workshops that will also cover machine and deep learning, a hands-on Azure session and finally a virtual tour of a Microsoft datacentre.
The dates for these further sessions will be confirmed shortly and added to the N8 CIR website here: [https://n8cir.org.uk/events/](https://n8cir.org.uk/events/)

**The booking link for this session will be shared as soon as the details are finalised with Microsoft.**
This will be in a newsletter to the N8 CIR mailing list and via the N8 CIR Twitter feed.
