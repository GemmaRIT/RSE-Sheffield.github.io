## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter September 2020

This is the 4th monthly newsletter from the Research Software Engineering Team at Sheffield. We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research.
This newsletter is a collection of interesting events and opportunities over the coming month. It also includes signposting to other resources that we have found beneficial or interesting.
You may find the content within interest if you are someone in research using software: such as researchers, research developers, or people paid to develop software like Research Software Engineers (RSEs).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/rse-group).

*All dates and times are in BST (UTC+01)*

#### Hacktoberfest 2020!

It's that time of the year again to brush up on our version control and online collaboration skills and carve some time out to learn more about and contribute to Open Source. Need more motivation? If you make 4 contributions to a participating project on GitHub you get an awesome limited edition t-shirt!

Contributing to open source can be fun and rewarding! It can also be daunting for new contributors, so the RSE team have put together a series of sessions to support folks new to open source and provide a space for folks to hack together. We [kicked off Hacktoberfest](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/workshop/2020-10-06-hacktoberfest/) on the 6th of October with an online session which included an introduction to open source and a practical exercise of making a pull request (contribution) using 3 different frameworks! (command, line, GitKraken, R & Rstudio). If you missed our session you can check out our [online materials](https://rse-shef-hacktoberfest-2020.netlify.app/). We'll then be hosting online hack sessions every Tuesday 2-4pm providing a space to hang out, hack together and get help if needed. Find our [more details and register](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/workshop/2020-10-06-hacktoberfest/) to get access to the hack room.

#### Lunchbytes

##### Lunch bytes #2: pros and cons of Jupyter Notebooks

The second edition of Lunchbytes was also a big success and focused on the [pros and cons of Jupyter Notebooks](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2020-10-07.html)! In particular, we hosted three short talks:

- **Making the most out of notebooks** John Charlton, <a href="https://rse.shef.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Sheffield RSE Team</a> [Slides](https://github.com/coolmule0/Making-the-most-of-jupyter-notebooks)

- **Pitfalls of Jupyter notebooks** Richard Darst, <a href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/" target="_blank">Aalto Scientific Computing</a>, <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en" target="_blank">Aalto University</a>

The [video recordings](https://digitalmedia.sheffield.ac.uk/media/t/1_3qv4p0mw) of the session are also now available.

##### Lunch bytes #1: writing safer (Python) code
