## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter December 2020

This is the 6th monthly newsletter from the Research Software Engineering Team at The University of Sheffield. We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research.
This newsletter is a collection of interesting events and opportunities over the coming month. It also includes signposting to other resources that we have found beneficial or interesting.
You may find the content interesting if you are someone in research using software: such as researchers, research developers, or people paid to develop software like Research Software Engineers (RSEs).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/rse-group).

*All dates and times are in GMT (UTC+00)*

### Puzzle Corner

If you think that programming is fun, and you might be looking
for a pastime as the (boreal) winter nights draw in, you might
like to try [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) which is
a series of problems that are designed to be solved with the aid
of a computer.

Euler Problem 1―Multiples of 3 and 5― is:

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
> 
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Software and Updates

- [RStudio v1.4 Preview: Python
  Support](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/10/07/rstudio-v1-4-preview-python-support/):
  The preview has had a minor update, so might be worth a look if
  you haven't tried it yet. Find out about a number of features that will further improve the Python editing experience in Rstudio release 1.4.
- Tool of the month — [dot from graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/about/)
  <br>![A 4 layer graph with a K<sub>2,2</sub> in the
  middle](/assets/images/dot-example.png){: float: left}
  My pick for ancient Unix tool of the month
  is the venerable [dot from graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/about/).
  I have recently been using this to draw graph networks from git repos.
  `dot` converts a simple text representation of a graph network
  into a PNG file or other graphic format.
  The shell script to generate the network graphic:

    ```
    dot -Tpng > graph.png <<EOF
    digraph G {
      a -> {b1 b2} -> {c1 c2} -> d
    }
    EOF
    ```


### Resources
* The British Ecological Society has a number of excellent [*Guides to Better Science*](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/publications/guides-to/), including:
  * [Reproducible Code](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BES-Guide-Reproducible-Code-2019.pdf) [PDF]

This month's pick is the ['*code clinic*' series](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/search?keywords=code%20clinic) in which a similar set of problems are tackled in different languages, a good way to transfer your knowledge of one language to another:
  * [R](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/code-clinic-r-2)
  * [Python](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/code-clinic-python-2)
  * [C++](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/code-clinic-c-plus-plus-2)
  * [Java](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/code-clinic-java-2)
