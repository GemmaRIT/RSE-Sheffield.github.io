## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter November 2020

This is the 5th monthly newsletter from the Research Software Engineering Team at The University of Sheffield. We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research.
This newsletter is a collection of interesting events and opportunities over the coming month. It also includes signposting to other resources that we have found beneficial or interesting.
You may find the content interesting if you are someone in research using software: such as researchers, research developers, or people paid to develop software like Research Software Engineers (RSEs).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/rse-group).

*All dates and times are in GMT (UTC+00)*
