## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter September 2020

This is the 3rd monthly newsletter from the Research Software Engineering Team at Sheffield. We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research.
This newsletter is a collection of interesting events and opportunities over the coming month. It also includes signposting to other resources that we have found beneficial or interesting.
You may find the content within interest if you are someone in research using software: such as researchers, research developers, or people paid to develop software like Research Software Engineers (RSEs).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/rse-group).

*All dates and times are in BST (UTC+01)*

#### Lunchbytes

A new monthly series of short talks on research computing, data workflows, and infrastructure.  The first session is to be on 12:00-13:00 9th September 2020 and is themed around *writing safer Python code*:

 - Type Annotations - how to reduce the risk of passing the wrong type of argument to functions (Joe Heffer, IT Services)
 - Automatable testing of code using pytest (David Jones, RSE team)
 - Writing safer functions that are easier to reason about (Will Furnass, RSE team)

Each talk will be ~10 minutes, leaving half an hour for discussion/questions.

You'll notice that all presenters are from IT Services or the RSE team; in future we hope that people from the research community feel able to either *request* LunchBytes talks from others or *offer* LunchBytes talks on topics they find interesting.  We'll tell you more about the mechanisms for making requests / offering talks at the first meetup!

Sign up to our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/rse-group) to be notified of Blackboard Collaborate joining instructions!

The following Lunchbytes is scheduled for October. It will be lead by our own David Wilby. The topic is regarding: "Notebooks - good or evil". We invite people with experience and thoughts in this topic to give a talk. Please get in contact to find out more.
